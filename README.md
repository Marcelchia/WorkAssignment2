# WorkAssignment2


Q)What did you like about this project?

A:This project gives me confidence in building a website to beautify it. Learn alot and experiment as a result of doing it on my own. 



Q)What did you struggle with in this project?

A:Flexbox is much harder than it looks. struggled quite abit with the mobile version and certain parts of css such as finding the appriopriate flex-container to adjust.
Images in mobile very out of place. Could not figure out how to adjust footer in main page even though flex container is different from
previous section




Q)What would make your experience with this assessment better?

A:shorten the time for this, because sometimes when you do know how to do, being stuck at a problem after a certain time will be inefficient.
